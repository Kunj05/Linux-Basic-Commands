# Web Vulnerabilities

## Introduction

### What is OWASP?

The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a worldwide not-for-profit charitable organization focused on improving the security of software. OWASP provides impartial, practical information about application security and aims to help organizations build secure software.

### OWASP Top Ten

The OWASP Top Ten is a standard awareness document for developers and web application security. It represents a broad consensus about the most critical security risks to web applications. The list is updated regularly to reflect the evolving landscape of web application security threats.

## Web Vulnerabilities

Web vulnerabilities are security weaknesses in web applications that can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access, manipulate data, or disrupt services. Understanding these vulnerabilities is crucial for developers, administrators, and security professionals to protect web applications from potential threats.

### Types of Web Vulnerabilities

1. **SQL Injection (SQLi)**
   - **Description**: SQL Injection occurs when an attacker inserts malicious SQL queries into an input field, allowing them to manipulate the database.
   - **Example**: An attacker enters `' OR '1'='1` in a login field to bypass authentication.
   - **Prevention**: Use parameterized queries and prepared statements.
   - **Cheat Sheet**: [SQL Injection Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/SQL_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html)

2. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
   - **Description**: XSS vulnerabilities allow attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
   - **Example**: An attacker injects a `<script>` tag in a comment section, which steals session cookies when other users view the comment.
   - **Prevention**: Validate and sanitize user inputs, and use Content Security Policy (CSP).
   - **Cheat Sheet**: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/XSS_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html)
   
   #### Types of XSS
   - **Stored XSS**: The malicious script is stored on the server (e.g., in a database) and is displayed to users when they access the infected content.
     - **Example**: A comment field where an attacker posts a script that runs when others view the comment.
   - **Reflected XSS**: The malicious script is reflected off a web server, such as in an error message, search result, or any other response that includes input from the user.
     - **Example**: A search query where an attacker includes a script that runs in the search results page.
   - **DOM-based XSS**: The vulnerability exists in the client-side code rather than the server-side code.
     - **Example**: An attacker manipulates the DOM environment in the user's browser to execute malicious scripts.
   - **Cheat Sheet**: [DOM based XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/DOM_based_XSS_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html)

3. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**
   - **Description**: CSRF tricks a user into performing actions on a web application without their consent.
   - **Example**: An attacker sends a link to a user that, when clicked, makes a request to transfer funds from the user's account.
   - **Prevention**: Use anti-CSRF tokens and validate the origin of requests.
   - **Cheat Sheet**: [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html)

4. **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)**
   - **Description**: IDOR occurs when an application exposes a reference to an internal object, allowing attackers to access unauthorized data.
   - **Example**: An attacker changes the URL from `/user/123` to `/user/124` to access another user's data.
   - **Prevention**: Implement proper access controls and validate user permissions.
   - **Cheat Sheet**: [Insecure Direct Object References Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Insecure_Direct_Object_Reference_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html)

5. **Security Misconfiguration**
   - **Description**: Security misconfiguration arises from improper configuration of security settings in applications or servers.
   - **Example**: Leaving default passwords unchanged or enabling directory listing on a web server.
   - **Prevention**: Regularly review and update configurations, disable unnecessary features, and use secure defaults.
   - **Cheat Sheet**: [Security Misconfiguration Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Configuration_Cheat_Sheet.html)

6. **Sensitive Data Exposure**
   - **Description**: Sensitive data exposure happens when applications fail to adequately protect sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, or personal data.
   - **Example**: Storing passwords in plain text or transmitting sensitive data over unencrypted connections.
   - **Prevention**: Use strong encryption, secure storage mechanisms, and enforce HTTPS.
   - **Cheat Sheet**: [Sensitive Data Exposure Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Sensitive_Data_Exposure_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html)

7. **Broken Authentication and Session Management**
   - **Description**: Flaws in authentication and session management can allow attackers to compromise user accounts.
   - **Example**: Session IDs exposed in URLs or insufficient password policies.
   - **Prevention**: Implement multi-factor authentication, use secure session management, and enforce strong password policies.
   - **Cheat Sheet**: [Authentication Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Authentication_Cheat_Sheet.html)

8. **XML External Entities (XXE)**
   - **Description**: XXE attacks exploit vulnerabilities in XML parsers to access or manipulate data and resources.
   - **Example**: An attacker includes an external entity in an XML file to retrieve sensitive files from the server.
   - **Prevention**: Disable external entities in XML parsers and use less complex data formats such as JSON.
   - **Cheat Sheet**: [XXE Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/XML_External_Entity_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html)

9. **Broken Access Control**
   - **Description**: Broken access control vulnerabilities occur when applications do not properly restrict user permissions, allowing unauthorized actions.
   - **Example**: An attacker accesses admin functionality by changing their user role in the request.
   - **Prevention**: Implement proper role-based access controls and regularly audit permissions.
   - **Cheat Sheet**: [Access Control Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Access_Control_Cheat_Sheet.html)

10. **Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities**
    - **Description**: This occurs when applications use libraries, frameworks, or other software modules with known security vulnerabilities.
    - **Example**: Using an outdated version of a third-party library with a known vulnerability.
    - **Prevention**: Regularly update and patch software components and use tools to identify known vulnerabilities.
    - **Cheat Sheet**: [Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Using_Components_with_Known_Vulnerabilities.html)

11. **Insufficient Logging and Monitoring**
    - **Description**: Insufficient logging and monitoring allow attackers to exploit systems without detection, hindering the response to security incidents.
    - **Example**: A breach goes unnoticed due to lack of logs and alert mechanisms.
    - **Prevention**: Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring solutions and regularly review logs.
    - **Cheat Sheet**: [Logging Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Logging_Cheat_Sheet.html)
